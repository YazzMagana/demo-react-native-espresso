* [Watchman](https://facebook.github.io/watchman/docs/install.html)
* [NodeJS:](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
    * [React-Native-CLI v2.0.1](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-cli)
    * [React-Native v0.57.4](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native)

<br />

## Project Setup
1. Install homebrew: https://brew.sh/
2. `brew install node`
3. `brew install watchman`
4. `npm install -g react-native-cli`
5. Install [JDK8](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html)
6. Install and configure [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/#downloads)
    * Choose a "Custom" setup when prompted to select an installation type. Make sure the boxes next to all of the following are checked:
      - Android SDK
      - Android SDK Platform
      - Performance (Intel Â® HAXM)
      - Android Virtual Device
    * Open the SDK Manager (SDK Platforms section) and choose to install "Android 8.1 (Oreo)" - check the box that says "Show package details" and choose:
      - Android SDK platform 27
      - Google APIs Intel x86 Atom System Image
      - DO NOT CLICK 'APPLY' YET!
    * Also go to the SDK Manager's SDK Tools section - check the box that says "Show package details" and choose:
      - "27.0.3" under the Android SDK Build-Tools tree
      - Now click 'Apply' to pull down and install all the new dependencies
    * Add the following lines to your $HOME/.bash_profile config file:
```
export ANDROID_HOME=$HOME/Library/Android/sdk
export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/emulator
export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/tools
export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/tools/bin
export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/platform-tools
```
7. Open `./sample-app-ios/android` as a project in Android Studio
8. Under the **Tools** menu, choose **AVD Manager**
9. Click the **Create Virtual Device** button
10. Choose a device definition (e.g. Pixel 2) and click **Next**
11. Choose **Oreo** with **API 27** and click **Next**
    > you may need to select **Download** beside **Oreo 27** to enable the **Next** button
12. Click **Finish** to create the emulated device
13. Launch the virtual device in the Android Emulator by clicking on the green triangle icon. 
14. Navigate to the root directory `demo-react-native-espresso`, open a shell and run: `react-native run-android`

> **WARNING**: if you don't manually launch the emulator, `run-android` returns:

```
FAILURE: Build failed with an exception.
    
* What went wrong:

## Bundling a React-Native App
**...or more specifically, how to bundle a `reactive-native` android app to run on Sauce Labs virtual devices and emulators**. 

In addition to mobile application testing on [Virtual Devices](https://wiki.saucelabs.com/display/DOCS/Automated+Mobile+App+Testing+on+Virtual+Devices+with+Sauce+Labs) with Appium, Sauce Labs also offers the ability to run tests with native frameworks such as:
* Espresso (Android)
* XCUITest (iOS)

Which allows you to build apps in Java/Swift and acheive app > test synchronization.

However, if you build your application with **`react-native`**, you must configure your Espresso test framework a bit differently. Furthermore, in order to test on Sauce Labs Virtual Devices, you must bundle your application in a specific way.

<br />

## Running the Demo
1. Clone [this repository]().
2. Open Android Studio and import as a **New Project** with  **`/android`** as the root-level project directory
2. Run the following command from the `./android/app` directory:
    ```
    keytool -genkey -v -keystore sLSwagLab.keystore -alias sLSwagLab -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000
    ```
    Set the password as:
    ```
    sl.swag.lab
    ```
    > You can also view these details in `gradle.properties`
    
3. Ensure you've set the following in `build.gradle.signingConfigs.release`:
    ```
    if (project.hasProperty('MYAPP_RELEASE_STORE_FILE')) {
        storeFile file(MYAPP_RELEASE_STORE_FILE)
        storePassword MYAPP_RELEASE_STORE_PASSWORD
        keyAlias MYAPP_RELEASE_KEY_ALIAS
        keyPassword MYAPP_RELEASE_KEY_PASSWORD
    }
    ```
4. Ensure you've set the following in `build.gradle.buildTypes.release`:
    ```
    signingConfig signingConfigs.release
    ```
5. Export your [Sauce Labs Credentials as Environment Variables](https://wiki.saucelabs.com/display/DOCS/Best+Practice%3A+Use+Environment+Variables+for+Authentication+Credentials)
6. Navigate to the directory where you downloaded the Sauce Runner and create a `runner.sh` script:
    > In our example they exist in: **./android/app/build/outputs/apk**
    
    ```
    ./sauce-runner-virtual-0.1.1-osx/bin/sauce-runner-virtual \
   -u $SAUCE_USERNAME \
   -k $SAUCE_ACCESS_KEY \
   -f espresso \
   -a <your android-release.apk location> \
   -t <your androidTest-debug.apk location> \
   -d 'deviceName=Samsung Galaxy S8 HD GoogleAPI Emulator,platformVersion=7.0' \
   -d 'deviceName=Google Pixel GoogleAPI Emulator,platformVersion=7.1'
    ```
7. Run the following command:
    ```
    ./runner.sh
    ```
